1. Create the Source Code for the Library
You need to have the C source code that contains the functions you want to include in the library. Let's assume the file is named sum.c.

Example (sum.c):


// sum.c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int sub(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}

int mult(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}

2. Compile the Object File for the Library
Next, compile the sum.c file to create the object file (sum.o):

gcc -c sum.c 

-c: Tells the compiler to compile the source code into an object file, not an executable.

3. Create the Static Library
Now, use the ar command to bundle the object file into a static library named libsum.a:


ar -rs libsum.a sum.o

 ar: The tool used to create or modify archives (static libraries).
 
-r: Replace or add the object file (sum.o) in the library (libsum.a).

-s: Create an index for faster access to functions in the library.

libsum.a: The name of the static library being created or updated.

sum.o: The object file that contains the compiled functions to be included in the library.

4. Create the Main Program
Create the main program source file that will use the functions from the static library. Letâ€™s name this file summain.c.

Example (summain.c):


// summain.c
#include <stdio.h>

// Declare the functions from the library
int add(int, int);
int sub(int, int);
int mult(int, int);

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;

   printf("Add: %d\n", add(a, b));
   printf("Sub: %d\n", sub(a, b));
   printf("Mult: %d\n", mult(a, b));

  return 0;
}
5. Compile the Main Program and Link with the Static Library
Now, compile the summain.c file and link it with the static library (libsum.a). Use the following command:


gcc summain.c -o sumprog -L. -lsum
-L.: Tells the compiler to look for the library in the current directory.
-lsum: Links against the static library (libsum.a). The prefix lib and the extension .a are omitted.
6. Run the Program
Now, run the program:


./sumprog
This will execute the program and print the results of the add, sub, and mult functions from the static library.

Summary of Commands:

gcc -c sum.c               # Step 2: Compile sum.c to sum.o
ar -rs libsum.a sum.o           # Step 3: Create the static library libsum.a
gcc summain.c -o sumprog -L. -lsum  # Step 5: Compile main program and link with static library
./sumprog                       # Step 6: Run the program
